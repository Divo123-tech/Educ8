## **Installation Guide**

Follow these steps to get Educ8 up and running on your local machine.

### **Backend (Django + Channels)**

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/educ8.git
    cd educ8/server
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the environment variables**:
    Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Set the necessary values like your database URL, secret key, etc.

5. **Run database migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Start Redis server** (make sure Redis is installed):
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

7. **Run the Django development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### **Frontend (React + Vite)**

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Vite development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now, you should have both the backend and frontend running locally on your machine! ðŸŽ‰

## **Development Setup**

To contribute or modify the code, you'll need to set up your environment for development. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Divo123-tech/educ8.git
    ```

2. Set up a **Python virtual environment** for the backend and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install **Node.js and NPM** (if not already installed) and run:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start Redis** for WebSockets:
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

5. **Run Backend & Frontend**:
    - Backend: `python manage.py runserver`
    - Frontend: `npm run dev`

## **Deployment**

For production deployment, we use **AWS S3**, **AWS RDS**, and **Docker** to ensure scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - **AWS RDS**: The backend database is hosted on **AWS RDS** (PostgreSQL), providing a managed, scalable, and secure database environment.
   - **Redis**: Used for caching and real-time communication (WebSockets).
   - **Docker**: The backend is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistency across environments and simplifying deployment to AWS or other platforms.
   - **Django Settings**: Configuration for production environments (e.g., `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, etc.) is done in the `settings.py` file, making it ready for AWS deployment.

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - The **React** application is built using `npm run build` and deployed to **AWS S3** for serving static assets. AWS S3 provides scalable storage for your static files and is optimized for fast content delivery.

3. **Real-Time Communication (WebSockets)**:
   - For real-time chat and notifications, the backend uses **Django Channels** with **WebSockets**. Redis is used as a message broker to handle WebSocket connections in a distributed manner, ensuring scalability.

4. **Containerization**:
   - Both the backend and frontend are containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Docker simplifies the process of deploying the application to various cloud platforms, including AWS.

By leveraging AWS services and Docker, the deployment is optimized for scalability, reliability, and performance in a production environment.
