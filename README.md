### **Backend (Django + Channels)**

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/educ8.git
    cd educ8/server
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the environment variables**:
    Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Set the necessary values like your database URL, secret key, etc.

5. **Run database migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Start Redis server** (make sure Redis is installed):
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

7. **Run the Django development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### **Frontend (React + Vite)**

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Vite development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now, you should have both the backend and frontend running locally on your machine! ðŸŽ‰
